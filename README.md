# Machine Learning Projects

A collection of machine learning projects and experiments demonstrating various algorithms and techniques.

## Project Overview

This repository showcases multiple machine learning projects, each focusing on different algorithms and methodologies. The projects include detailed analyses, code implementations, and discussions on performance metrics.

## Dataset Description

Each project utilizes specific datasets pertinent to the problem being addressed. For instance, the "Student Placement Prediction" project uses a dataset with the following columns:

- **CGPA**: Cumulative Grade Point Average of students.
- **IQ**: Intelligence Quotient scores of students.
- **Placement**: Binary indicator of whether a student was placed (1) or not (0).

- 
 **Credits**: Itâ€™s important to credit the original source (Campus X) Nitish Sir.
